ibis.set_backend("pandas")
ibis.get_backend()

----------------------------------------------

[Tips]
- To set the Ibis backend, use ibis.set_backend(). 
To check the backend, use ibis.get_backend(). 
- It supports the following processing engines. 

bigquery, clickhouse, dask, datafusion, druid, duckdb, exasol, 
flink, impala, mssql, mysql, oracle, pandas, polars, postres, 
pyspark, snowflake, sqlite, trino 

It supports connections to MotherDuck for DuckDB. 
It is also possible to use CuDF as the backend. 
For use of CuDF, refer to the following article.

- Note that some Ibis methods do not work 
depending on the processing engine specified in the backend 
(eg. can be executed in pandas but error in duckdb)
