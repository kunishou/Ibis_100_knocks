t_copy = t
t_copy.head()

[Tips]
- Ibis does not have a copy method like pandas does. This is
  because Ibis is not a library for directly manipulating
  dataframes, but for building queries for data
  manipulation. Moreover, Ibis query expressions perform
  lazy evaluation on the actual data on the database, so
  there is no concept of copying the data itself.
- However, as the answer shows, it is possible to achieve an
  effect similar to pandas' copy method. In this case, 
  after the operation t_copy = t, manipulating the value
  of t does not affect t_copy because, in the chronological
  order of the query expressions, t = t_copy is executed
  earlier.
