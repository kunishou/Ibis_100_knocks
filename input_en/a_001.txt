ibis.options.interactive = True 

----------------------------------------------

[tips]
By default, Ibis operates in low latency evaluation mode. 
If you want to interactively check the results of data analysis, 
or for debugging during development, 
set ibis.options.interactive = True 
for eager evaluation mode.

- Lazy Evaluation mode
In low latency mode, 
evaluation is not performed until 
actual execution is requested. This allows Ibis 
to secure time for planning and optimizing 
data processing. Specifically, Ibis 
operations (filtering, selection, 
aggregation, etc.) are not directly 
executed on the databases or datasets to 
which they should be applied, 
but are accumulated as a plan of a 
series of operations.

The advantage of this mode is that 
the queries sent to the database 
are more efficient. Ibis sends to 
the database a series of operations 
on the data as a single optimized 
query. This reduces network 
overhead and reduces the 
load on the database.

To actually perform operations, 
run the ".execute()" method 
at the end of the code.

- Eager Evaluation mode
In eager evaluation mode, 
each operation is performed 
directly as it is written. 
This is similar to the 
standard Python evaluation method. 
For example, when you apply a 
filtering operation to 
a dataset in Ibis, 
the operation is immediately 
sent to the database 
and the result is returned. 

The advantages of this mode are 
immediacy and transparency. 
You can see the results of 
the operations immediately, and it 
is convenient for debugging 
and working with 
small datasets.
