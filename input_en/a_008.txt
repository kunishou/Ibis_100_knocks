t.order_by("fare") # Sort in ascending order
# t.order_by(ibis.desc("fare")) # Sort in descending order

----------------------------------------------

[Tips]
-  By using the .order_by() method, you can sort
data by a specific column. By default, it sorts in
ascending order.
-  If you want to sort in descending order, you can
write it as t.order_by(t["fare"].desc()).
-  Writing t.order_by(ibis.desc("fare")) can also
achieve descending order sorting.
-  It's also possible to sort by multiple columns

ex1) If you want to sort by the "fare" column in
ascending order, and then by the "age" column
in ascending order, note the order of columns
in the list

t.order_by(["age", "fare"])

ex2) If you want to sort by the "fare" column in
descending order, and then by the "age" column
in descending order, note the order of columns
in the list

t.order_by([ibis.desc("age"), ibis.desc("fare")])

ex3) If you want to sort by the "fare" column in
descending order, and then by the "age" column
in ascending order, note the order of columns
in the list

t.order_by([ibis.asc("age"), ibis.desc("fare")])
