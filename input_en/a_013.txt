t.info()

----------------------------------------------

[Tips]
To check the metadata of a table, use the .info() method.
When executed, data with the following columns is obtained:

name:
Indicates the name of each column in the table.
Each column represents a different aspect of the data within the table.

type:
Indicates the data type of each column, such as int64, float64, string, etc.
Data type affects the operations and functions that can be used with that column,
as well as how the column is processed in the database.

nullable:
Indicates whether the column is allowed to contain NULL values.
If True, the column can contain NULL values.
If False, the column cannot contain NULL values.

nulls:
Indicates the number of NULL values in a column.
This is particularly important for data cleansing and dealing with missing values.

non_nulls:
Indicates the number of non-NULL values in a column, that is,
the number of records that actually have a value.

null_frac:
Indicates the fraction of NULL values within a column.
This represents the ratio of the number of NULL values to the total number of records,
and is useful for assessing data quality and the impact of missing values.

pos:
Indicates the position of a column within the table.
The first column is numbered as 0, and each subsequent column is numbered in the order that follows.
The position of a column is important when it relates to data manipulation or column selection.

df.info()

* Note that pandas' info() does not display statistical information.
To check statistical information with pandas, use df.describe().
