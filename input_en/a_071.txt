t2.aggregate(
    t2[col].sum() for col in ["English", "Mathematics", "History"]
)


----------------------------------------------

[Tips]
- Using the aggregate() method, you can perform 
 aggregate operations such as the sum, average, 
 maximum, minimum, and count for specific 
 columns. It is often used in combination with 
 group_by().
- Calculate the sum for each column in t2[col].
  Repeat this for the number of columns using a for loop.

[Reference] pandas syntax

df2 = df2.drop(['class'], axis=1)
print(df2.sum()) # Sum along the columns
